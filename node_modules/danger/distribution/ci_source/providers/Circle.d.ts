/**
 *  ### CI Setup
 *
 *  For setting up Circle CI, we recommend turning on "Only Build pull requests." in "Advanced Setting." Without this enabled,
 *  it is _really_ tricky for Danger to know whether you are in a pull request or not, as the environment metadata
 *  isn't reliable.
 *
 *  With that set up, you can you add `yarn danger` to your `circle.yml`. If you override the default
 *  `test:` section, then add it as an extra step. Otherwise add a new `pre` section to the test:
 *
 *    ``` ruby
 *    test:
 *      override:
 *          - yarn danger
 *    ```
 *
 *  ### Token Setup
 *
 *  There is no difference here for OSS vs Closed, add your `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to the Environment variable settings page.
 *
 *  ### I still want to run commit builds
 *
 *  OK, alright. So, if you add a `DANGER_CIRCLE_CI_API_TOKEN` then Danger will use the Circle API to look up
 *  the status of whether a commit is inside a PR or not. You can generate a token from inside the project set_trace_func
 *  then go to Permissions > "API Permissions" and generate a token with access to Status. Take that token and add
 *  it to Build Settings > "Environment Variables".
